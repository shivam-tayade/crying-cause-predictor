# Crying Cause Predictor

## Project Overview  
This project is a web-based application that uses an AI model to predict the cause of a babyâ€™s crying. The user can upload or record an audio clip of the baby's cry, and the machine learning model analyzes the audio to determine the reason behind the cry (e.g., hunger, discomfort, etc.). The model was developed in Python using Google Colab and integrated into a user-friendly web interface.

## Key Features  
- **Audio Upload and Recording:** Users can either upload an audio file or record live audio directly through the website.
- **AI-Based Prediction:** The machine learning model analyzes the audio and predicts the reason for the baby's cry.
- **Simple Interface:** A clean and intuitive design allows users to easily upload or record audio and receive predictions.
- **Real-Time Results:** Immediate feedback after submitting an audio file.

## Setup Instructions  
1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Install required Python libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and Librosa for audio processing.
3. Set up a local server using Flask or Django to run the web application.
4. Deploy the pre-trained machine learning model for predicting baby cry causes.
5. Run the application on localhost or deploy it to a cloud platform like Heroku.

## Technologies Used  
- **Machine Learning:** Python (TensorFlow, Keras) for training and deploying the baby cry prediction model.
- **Audio Processing:** Librosa for extracting features from audio files.
- **Web Development:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript for front-end development.
- **Backend Integration:** Flask for handling backend requests and integrating with the machine learning model.
- **Google Colab:** For training and testing the machine learning model.
